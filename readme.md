# Wordpress Age verifier Plugin by Alibori
## Get your visitors noticed that there is an age restriction to visit your site 🕵️‍

This plugin allows you to set a *heading text*, *body text*, *confirm button text* and *negation button text* to display on the frontend a popup.

If the custom logo of the site is set it will be rendered too 😎

This plugin uses the **localStorage** to know the need to show or not this popup.

**CAUTION:** This plugin works if the content to be hide is written under the *\<main>* tag. Feel free to change this behaviour in the *assets/js/main.js* file.

I hope you like it, use it, and give me a 🌟!
